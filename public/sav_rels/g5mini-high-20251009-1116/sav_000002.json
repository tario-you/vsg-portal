  "description": "A small herd of goats on a grassy riverbank: a foreground goat (wearing a cloth) walks through the frame and grazes; a second goat appears starting mid-clip and the two end up grazing together; a third goat is intermittently visible in the background near the water. Two rabbits appear briefly in the first two frames. Several plastic bags and vegetation are static props in the scene. The camera remains steady and keeps the animals in frame.",

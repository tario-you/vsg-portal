  "description": "Handheld footage of a supermarket entrance corridor. Multiple shoppers walk through the entrance area; two different people interact with a shopping cart (one in the early frames, a second person in the later frames). One shopper carries a backpack from mid-clip. The camera remains mostly stationary while it visually frames/focuses on the approaching shopper and cart as they move toward the camera.",

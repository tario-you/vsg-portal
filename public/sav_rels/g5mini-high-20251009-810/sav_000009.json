  "description": "An outdoor evening gathering at a small decorated stage/altar. The handheld camera starts low on a blanket and ground area, pans upward to reveal a speaker/PA and a garlanded statue on a raised ledge, then later pans down toward seated participants and a cluster of shoes on the ground. Several people sit on chairs or the ledge and appear to watch and listen to the stage while others move into the seating area.",

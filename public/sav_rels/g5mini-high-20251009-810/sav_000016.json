  "description": "A handheld camera moves through a small backyard chicken enclosure. Early frames show a white rooster walking, perching on and pecking around wooden logs/posts under a tarp-covered shelter. The camera then pans away (briefly showing a curtain/bench and a planting area) where a child appears for two frames, and finally the camera pans back to reframe the rooster in the coop.",

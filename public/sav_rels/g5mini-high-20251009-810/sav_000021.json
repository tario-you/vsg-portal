  "description": "A toddler in a living room plays with a small pink ball. The child initially holds the ball near the doorway, releases/throws it so the ball bounces and rolls across the marble floor toward the sofa; the child walks/chases the ball, leans on the sofa and then retrieves it. A handheld camera follows and pans to the child and the ball throughout the clip.",

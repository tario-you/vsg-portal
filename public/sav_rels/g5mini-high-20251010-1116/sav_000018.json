  "description": "A handheld camera pans right from a closed storefront/corridor into a brightly lit indoor mall / food-court. Early (frames 0\u20132) a small group of pedestrians walks through the corridor; as the camera sweeps right it reveals floor rails, decorative overhead lights, pillars and multiple neon/sign boards. The camera then steadies and frames the food-court signage and seating area in the latter part of the clip.",

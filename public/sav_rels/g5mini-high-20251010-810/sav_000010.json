  "description": "A small indoor studio / photography setup where a man adjusts tripods and a ring light while others stand and talk near a desk. Later a different person approaches the table, picks up a flash unit and handles a bag. The unseen recording camera stays focused on the ring light for most of the clip and briefly frames the person handling gear.",

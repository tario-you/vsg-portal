  "description": "Several people are in an indoor studio-like room setting up and using photographic lighting and tripods. A man repeatedly holds/adjusts a tripod while a large ring light is powered on; two people near a mirror are talking and looking at the mirror. Another person briefly picks up a flash unit from a table. The unseen camera slightly pans/tilts and stays framed on the ring light and the people during the clip.",

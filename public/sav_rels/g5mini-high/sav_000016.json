  "description": "A handheld camera films an outdoor chicken pen. A white rooster is visible at the pen early in the clip, walks among logs/posts and briefly perches on wooden supports. The camera operator then pans away through garden vegetation, briefly captures a child walking through the plants, and later pans back to the pen and the rooster.",

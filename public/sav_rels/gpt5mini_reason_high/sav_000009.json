  "description": "Night-time outdoor event at a small decorated altar/platform. A portable speaker and cables sit on a low table while blankets/mats lie on the ground. People arrive and sit at chairs/ledges near the altar; one person appears to operate the speaker/audio while others sit, converse and later remove footwear and gather near mats. The handheld camera pans from the blanket/floor area to the speaker and altar, then later toward seated people and the shoe area.",

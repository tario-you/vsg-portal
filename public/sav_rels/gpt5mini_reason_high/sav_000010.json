  "description": "An indoor studio/room where a small crew sets up lighting and camera gear. A large ring light is on and powered; a man steadies/adjusts a tripod-mounted ring light while a group converses near a mirror. Later, a different person handles a flash and bag in a close-up sequence. The unseen camera alternates focus between the ring light/crew and the individual preparing equipment.",

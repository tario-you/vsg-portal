  "description": "A camera moves steadily forward along a city sidewalk. Initially, a person stands at the curb using a phone, then leaves the frame as the camera advances. Multiple pedestrians are seen walking toward the camera along the pathway, with some approaching and passing by as the camera continues to move forward. The environment includes buildings, trees, poles, and various tactile paving strips, but the main temporal changes involve the people and the camera's movement.",
